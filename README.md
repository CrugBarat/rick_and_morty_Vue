# Rick & Morty

A basic Rick & Morty search app, which uses an API as a data source:

**Programming Language**: JavaScript

**Web App Framework**: Vue

**Markup/Styling**: HTML5/CSS3

The mock Rick & Morty app can dynamically search data requested from an API and return details stored for a corresponding result. The app includes several interchangeable and reusable components to execute the character search, including a select menu, an unordered list and search bar.

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

# Brief

Your task is to create an app that shows info for all the characters of the TV show Rick and Morty using multiple components. Use the Rick and Morty API to make a request to get the data.

**MVP**

- Display a list of character names
- Add a click event to the list item which should then render more detail about that character
- Use reusable components

**Extensions**

- Instead of rendering a list, populate a dropdown with all of the characters names
- Add a change event to the select that renders information about the selected character

**Advanced Extensions**

- Add the characters image and origin name to the character detail component
- Add a search bar to the page so that when a user enters the characters name the character detail component renders. Try to achieve this without the user having to enter the whole name
